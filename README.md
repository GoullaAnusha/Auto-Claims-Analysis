# Auto Claims Analysis

This project analyzes auto claims data to provide insights and recommendations for an insurance company.

## Data

The dataset consists of auto claims filed by customers. It includes various features such as customer demographics, vehicle details, and claim amounts.

## Analysis Summary

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized the distribution of claim amounts.
- Analyzed the relationship between claim amounts and customer demographics.
- Explored patterns and trends in the data.

### Visualization
- Generated various plots to illustrate key findings, including:
  - Distribution of claim amounts.
  - Claims by vehicle type and customer age.
  - Heatmaps to identify geographical trends in claims.

## Key Findings

- **Customer Segmentation**: Demographics and behaviors linked to higher Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) include advanced education levels (e.g., Master's or Doctoral degrees) and certain employment statuses (e.g., "Disabled" or "Retired").

- **Policy Adjustments**: Different policy types show varying claims frequencies. "Personal" policies had the highest claims, suggesting a need for coverage or pricing adjustments. Conversely, "Corporate" policies had fewer claims, indicating potential for refined pricing strategies.

- **Impact of Active Policy Duration**: Longer active policy durations correlate with higher CLV, highlighting the importance of fostering long-term customer relationships and retention strategies.

- **Vehicle Class Influence**: Luxury vehicle classes such as "Luxury Car" and "Luxury SUV" had substantially higher CLV compared to standard vehicle classes like "Four-Door Car" or "Two-Door Car."

- **Monthly Premium Analysis**: High CLV customers generally had higher monthly premiums compared to those with negative CLV. This suggests that while high CLV customers may pay higher premiums, they also contribute more value to the company over their lifetime.

## Recommendations

- **Targeted Marketing**: Tailor campaigns to demographics with higher CLV, including females, Master's degree holders, singles, and disabled individuals.

- **Policy Adjustments**: Review and adjust coverage and pricing for high-claims policies like "Personal." Explore incentives for low-claims policies such as "Corporate" and consider customer needs.

- **Customer Retention**: Invest in personalized communication and loyalty programs, especially for long-term policyholders.

- **Vehicle Class-Based Pricing**: Offer tailored packages or discounts for owners of high CLV vehicle classes like Sports Cars and Luxury SUVs.

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly analyze CLV, claims frequency, and demographics to refine strategies and offerings.

Implementing these measures will help optimize profitability and enhance customer satisfaction.
